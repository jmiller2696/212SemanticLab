<h1>Silicon Chip Implant Marvel</h1>
<p>A team of researchers led by Chandan Sen at the Indiana University School of Medicine, is moving a new nanochip device,</p>
<p> which can reprogram skin cells in the body to become new blood vessels and nerve cells, out of the prototype phase.</p>

<h1>Legal Implications, IU School Of Medicine </h1>
<p>Unfortunately, doing this requires complicated laboratory procedures, and, along with many alternatives, can raise certain risks, including giving rise to cancerous cells.</p>

<h2>Other Areas of Research</h2>
<p>"This small silicon chip enables nanotechnology that can change the function of living body parts," says Sen, director of the Indiana Center for Regenerative Medicine and Engineering. "For example, if someone's blood vessels were damaged because of a traffic accident and they need blood supply, we can't rely on the pre-existing blood vessel anymore because that is crushed, but we can convert the skin tissue into blood vessels and rescue the limb at risk." </p>
